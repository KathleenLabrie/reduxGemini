      "The data we will be reducting today is of NGC 6872, a pretty spiral observed with GMOS-South.  The observing mode is optical imaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data were obtained on November 1st, 2010 (UT).  The **Program ID** is **GS-2010A-Q-7**.  Data in g', r', and i'-band were obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you go to [archive.gemini.edu](archive.gemini.edu) and search on the program number, you will find that observations were also attempted twice in July.  The weather interfered and the sequences were abandoned.  We will ignore those observations and use the full 3-band sequence from November 1st, 2010.  (File name root: 20101101)\n",
      "\n",
      "Back in 2010, GMOS-South was equipped with the old EEV CCDs.  (Now it has Hamamatsu CCDs.)  The old CCDs were read with only one amplifier.  This means that there is one extension per CCD.  (There are 3 CCDs.)  Also, with the old EEV CCDs, the fringing is quite significant in the i'-band.  We will need to correct for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because our pretty galaxy is an extended object, we can expect to use observations of a blank sky field to build a fringe frame of the i'-band.  This will be covered during the tutorial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go to the [Gemini Observatory Archive](archive.gemini.edu) and search for the science data using the Program ID.  You will find the following:\n",
