      "Remember that if a twilight is taken on a different date from the science data, it will need its own processed bias.   Once you have identified the twilights that you need, search for them explicitely by date and name at [archive.gemini.edu](archive.gemini.edu), then use the `Load Associated Calibrations` tab, it will list all the biases clearly.  However, be careful to have only your valid twilights in the list.  **Hint**: Target Name = \"Twilight\", they are \"dayCal\" observations, and our data is 2x2 binning.\n",
